Things to do in the near future:

- classes
- inheritance
- unnamed records/lists/maps
- enum

- defer statement
- yield & generators
- infix function notation (unary & binary)
- attributes
- emit IL
- main function & entry point
- symbol resolving
- scopes
- types as values
- expose slang types in sl
- lowering & ast rewriting
- separate binding

- match syntax
    - check for multiple cases
    - lowering
        - how as expression
        - reorder case sections, match-any last evaluated
        - match any only as stand alone


Things to do in the far future:
- emulation & VM
- byte code emitting
- LLVM
- C-interop


- Metaclasses
    - type MyType : mixin {}
    - class/struct/union/mixin/enum/interface are default metaclasses
